=== What is it

SuperDiff is a simple script that allows you to diff several files recursively,
following a given pattern, present in two different directories.

The idea came because we wanted to recap our work for a project that we
detached times ago from the original repository, and that in the meantime it
kept going on developed by its actual developers.
At some point we wanted to gather all the modification we did and tried to send
them hoping to be included as feature requests.
But at that moment checking the amount of files we changed and comparing them
to the original ones looked like a lot troublesome.

=== How it works

The script needs three parameters: two directories to check and a file pattern.

For example, if you want to compare all java files present in directories
A and B, run the command

./superdiff.sh A B *.java
